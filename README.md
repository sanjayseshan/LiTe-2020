# 2020 Science Fair

This is my code for my science fair project "Lightweight assistive technology: A wearable, optical-fiber gesture recognition system".

* For the science fair that never hapenned.....

Spliced data for machine learning (keras) prediction in splicedDataML

Code to predict in Jupyter Notebook predictML.ipynb

dataCollect.py to save data from Arduino for gesture cycles. readData.py just reads from serial port.

ArduinoCode in ArduinoCode/photoDiode2
